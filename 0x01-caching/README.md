# Description

This folder has assignments on caching strategies.
They are implemented in python although.

They are the following:

- FIFO (First In First Out)
- LIFO (Last In First Out)
- MRU (Most Recently Used)
- LRU (Least Recently Used)

In a nutshell they all use some sort of stack/queueing strategy.
To re-arrange or remove items.
